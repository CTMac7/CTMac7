--->Hi, I am new to GitHub, I'm @CTMac7 and I am interestred in learning all I can do with the Open Shell to replace the awful push merchandising of Microsoft and the 11 series.  I need to customize my computer for business and not gaming or socializing as Microsoft seems to think all of us are doing 7/24.  I would like links to what I can use Open Shell for in more ways than just a traditional start button ands program display that I have long preferred. In what other ways can I strip my Windows 11 of all the crap that MS wants me to obsess on and simply run my business efficiently and without constant diversions to make MS another buck.  Thanks for understanding and being the helpful sort of human that most of you are.
